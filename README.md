# Final-Project---Paul-Winston-V1.0
Basic user interface implemented for the Final project. Global dimming is not recorded in the video. More intuitive user selection using eye tracking is required. (gauge filling up while hovering) Look into XR interaction toolkit.
To do:
* Come up with a method of occlusion using shader.
* Build meaningful interactive scene. (Make as comfortable scene as possible)
* Come up with a method of waypoint path system for objects to dwell around the user.
* SFX (Sound effects)
